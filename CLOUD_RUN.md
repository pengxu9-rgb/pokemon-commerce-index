# Google Cloud staging deployment

The catalog API is packaged for a **private Cloud Run service** in `pivota-staging`, region `us-west1`. The image builds its SQLite catalog from the pinned JSONL inputs and a compressed, provenance-checked character/artist facet snapshot, then runs as a non-root user. It contains no marketplace credentials or live prices. The service exposes internal catalog routes only when started with `--internal-catalog-api`; Cloud Run IAM must remain enabled.

Deploy from the repository root:

```bash
bash scripts/deploy_cloud_run.sh pivota-staging us-west1
```

The script creates a dedicated runtime service account with no project roles if it does not exist, then deploys `pokemon-commerce-index` with unauthenticated access disabled, zero minimum instances and one maximum instance. It refuses `pivota-prod`. It does not grant Cloud Run Invoker to anyone; access must be assigned deliberately to the calling Pivota service identity or an operator.

Private routes: `/health`, `/catalog-status`, `/catalog-search?q=...`, `/catalog-search?dex_id=25`, `/catalog-search?illustrator=Naoyo%20Kimura`, `/catalog-card?card_id=...`, `/catalog-neighborhood?card_id=...`. The existing commerce routes remain gated by `display_allowed` and source policy. The catalog routes expose internal source metadata and must never be deployed with public invoker access.

The SQLite file in the image is a read-only catalog snapshot. It has structural variant neighbors but no curated counterpart edges. Exploration sessions are available through the local library and CLI only; they are not exposed by the HTTP service or persisted across deployments. Live offer collection, price observations, quotes and user exploration sessions need persistent storage outside Cloud Run's ephemeral filesystem before those features are deployed. A later production design can place normalized observations and session state in a managed database and use a separate scheduled ingestion worker; this staging service is the card catalog baseline.

Verify deployment:

```bash
gcloud run services describe pokemon-commerce-index \
  --project=pivota-staging --region=us-west1 \
  --format='value(status.url,status.conditions[0].status)'
gcloud run services get-iam-policy pokemon-commerce-index \
  --project=pivota-staging --region=us-west1 \
  --format=json
```

The IAM policy must not include `allUsers` or `allAuthenticatedUsers`. To query from an authorized principal, send a Google identity token in the `Authorization: Bearer` header to the service URL. No credentials are stored in this repository.
